By providing this information your bank is neither endorsing OfferBooth nor is it in any way responsible for the Services. <br><br>When you use your bank account, debit card, or credit card to deposit funds, you are requesting an electronic transfer of funds. For bank account transactions, OfferBooth will make electronic fund transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify. You agree that such requests constitute your authorization to OfferBooth to make such transfers. Once you have provided your authorization for a transfer, you will not be able to cancel the electronic transfer. You hereby give OfferBooth the right to resubmit any electronic fund  transfer you authorized that is returned for insufficient or uncollected funds. You also authorize us to amend your OfferBooth Account activity to correct such error. You authorize OfferBooth to take necessary action to reverse, credit, or debit any payment in connection with any necessary charge backs, reversals, refunds, or adjustments. <br><br>You agree that you will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds that you hold on deposit with Offerbooth and that OfferBooth handles and places in pooled accounts with its banking partners.

If OfferBooth requests that you complete a deposit in order to resolve a negative balance issue and you fail to do so, you authorize OfferBooth to initiate a deposit in the amount of such deficiency from your linked bank account or debit card.

You should periodically review statements from your bank, which should reflect all applicable payment transactions made using that payment method. You can also always access the record of your transactions by logging into your OfferBooth Account. </p>

                                                        <p>If an Unauthorized Transaction (as defined below) or Error (as defined below) occurs through your account, and you follow the procedures set forth in this Section, OfferBooth will reimburse you for the amount of any eligible Unauthorized Transaction and any losses resulting from an Error, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section. <br><br><b><u>What Constitutes an Unauthorized Transaction or Error? </u></b><br><br>For purposes of this Section, “Unauthorized Transaction” means a transaction that was initiated from your account without your authorization and that does not benefit you. </p>
                                                        <p class="para-small-font">For example, if someone steals your phone and makes a payment without your permission, it would constitute an Unauthorized Transaction. However, if you share your login credentials with someone who then sends money without your permission, that would not constitute an Unauthorized Transaction. </p>
                                                        <p>For purposes of this Section, an “Error” means one of the following: (i) if your bank account, debit card or credit card is charged for a deposit, OfferBooth receives the funds, but it doesn’t show up in your account, (ii) if you complete a transaction and the funds are not properly delivered by debit card or credit card, (iii) if you send a payment and we debit your account for an amount in excess of the send amount, (iv) if you receive a payment and we do not add the proper amount to your account, (v) if the transaction records in your OfferBooth Account do not accurately reflect your transactions.<br><br><b><u>Notifying OfferBooth of an Unauthorized Transaction or Error</u></b><br><br>You should notify us immediately if you believe that (i) an Unauthorized Transaction or Error has occurred, (ii) your password and/or two-factor authentication access has been compromised, (iii) a device on which you have downloaded the OfferBooth app or which contains an active OfferBooth session has been stolen or lost, or (iv) you believe there is an Error in your transaction records or account history, or you have a question regarding your transaction records or account history. </p>

                                                        <p><b><u>Notification Process</u></b><br><br>The fastest and most efficient way to notify us of an Unauthorized Transaction or Error is to contact Support via email at <b><u> <a href="mailto:support@offerbooth.com">support@offerbooth.com</a> </u></b> . You can also notify us by phone during our phone support hours by calling +91-89683-00669 or by sending an old fashioned letter to OfferBooth Internet Financial, Panchkula, India. If you choose to notify us by phone, we may require that you follow up any phone discussion with a written confirmation within ten (10) business days so that we have a documented record of your notification. <br><br>However you choose to notify us, you must include: (i) the name, email and phone number  associated with your OfferBooth Account, (ii) a detailed description of what Unauthorized Transaction or Error you believe occurred, or what information you need in order to determine if an Unauthorized Transaction or Error occurred, and (iii) the amount of such Unauthorized Transaction or Error. <br><br>Note that in connection with investigating and/or resolving any Unauthorized Transaction or Error, we may need to request further information from you regarding the circumstances of the Unauthorized Transaction or Error. If you do not provide such additional information, it may inhibit our ability to resolve your issue or your rights under this Section. <br><br><b><u>Steps OfferBooth Will Take Following Notification</u></b><br><br>Once you have provided us with proper notification (including delivering all of the information set forth in the subsection above and responding to any requests for further information), we will investigate the potential Unauthorized Transaction or Error. We will typically be able to complete our investigation within ten (10) days, but may require up to thirty (30) days if your account is new (meaning your account has been open for less than thirty (30) days at the time we receive your notification). <br><br>Sometimes, we may need more time in order to complete our investigation (up to thirty (30) days, or sixty (60) days for a new account). If we need to take more than ten (10) days to investigate your claim (or thirty (30) days for new accounts), we will provisionally credit your account with the amount of such Unauthorized Transaction or Error. <br><br>Once we have completed our investigation, we will notify you of our decision within three (3) business days. If we have determined that your claim of an Unauthorized  Transaction or Error is valid and eligible, we will credit your account for the amount of the Unauthorized Transaction or Error, subject to the limitations set forth below. If we have already provisionally credited your account and determine that your claim of an Unauthorized Transaction or Error is valid and eligible, you will be allowed to keep such provisional credit. If we have already provisionally credited your account and determine that your claim of an Unauthorized Transaction or Error is not valid and/or eligible, the amount provisionally credited will be debited from your account. <br><br>Regardless of the results of our investigation, we will send you an email explaining the basis for our decision. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our decision, you can request further information regarding the details that led to our decision. <br><br><b><u>Errors We Discover</u></b> <br><br>If we discover an Error on our own that results in you receiving less than the amount of funds to which you are entitled, we will rectify it by crediting your account for the difference. If we discover an Error on our own that results in you receiving more than the amount of funds to which you are entitled, we will rectify it by debiting your account for the difference. </p>

                                                        <p>If a payment that you receive is later invalidated for any reason, you are responsible to OfferBooth for the full amount of such payment. This means that if the sender disputes the authorization for transaction or initiates a chargeback with their bank or card issuer, you may be liable for the full amount of such payment. If it is determined that such transaction was unauthorized or the chargeback is validated by the sender’s bank or card issuer, you authorize OfferBooth to recover any amounts due to OfferBooth by deducting such amount from your OfferBooth Account balance. In the event that your OfferBooth Account balance is not sufficient to cover the full amount, you authorize OfferBooth to reverse any withdrawals or require you to take other steps to reimburse OfferBooth. If OfferBooth is unable to recover the full amount that is owed, OfferBooth may take additional steps including the initiation of legal actions to recover the full amount, to the extent allowed by applicable law. </p>

OfferBooth will make any tax withholdings or filings that we are required by law to make, but OfferBooth is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transaction, or for collecting, reporting, or remitting any taxes arising from any transaction. </p>
