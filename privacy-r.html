                                Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that operates on open source software 
                                protocols which can be used, modified or adapted by anyone; provided that 
                                certain changes require a certain amount of consensus among the parties 
                                using and supporting the Bitcoin network. As a result of the decentralized 
                                nature of Bitcoin it is possible that sudden, unexpected or controversial 
                                changes (“forks”) can be made to Bitcoin. It is also possible that such forks 
                                result in multiple versions of “Bitcoin” existing simultaneously. By using Circle 
                                you acknowledge and agree that: (i) Circle does not own or control the Bitcoin 
                                network and is not responsible for any losses you may incur as a result of the 
                                functionality or security of the Bitcoin network and (ii) Circle is not responsible 
                                for forks or changes to the Bitcoin network, any of which may result in 
                                significant and sudden changes to the value and/or usability of Bitcoin.<br><br>
                                
                                Customers who hold bitcoin in their Circle accounts should be aware that one 
                                or more “forks” of Bitcoin may be occurring in the very near future. The exact 
                                timing, nature, duration, outcome and impact of any “fork” of Bitcoin cannot be 
                                determined ahead of time. The only way to avoid being potentially negatively 
                                impacted by a “fork” of Bitcoin is to not hold bitcoin.<br><br>
                                
                                With respect to any potential “fork” of bitcoin, you acknowledge and agree 
                                that (i) Circle shall determine in its sole discretion which “fork” (or “forks”) of 
                                Bitcoin it will support (“Supported Bitcoin”) and Circle shall be under no 
                                obligation to support any other “forks” or versions of Bitcoin. Unless Circle in 
                                its sole discretion chooses to do so, Circle does not and will not support any 
                                forked versions of Bitcoin, or any other digital currencies, tokens, coins or 
                                forked protocols (collectively, “Other Digital Currencies”) whether or not they 
                                are created as a result of a fork of the Bitcoin network, are independently 
                                created or otherwise, and regardless of whether or not such Other Digital 
                                Currencies hold any value. You acknowledge and agree that you will not use 
                                your Circle account to hold, send, receive or otherwise transact with any 
                                Other Digital Currencies. In the event that you attempt to use your Circle 
                                account to transact with Other Digital Currencies, Circle is under no obligation 
                                to take any measures to help you recover any such Other Digital Currencies or 
                                make you whole for any losses associated with such Other Digital Currencies. 
                                Holding Supported Bitcoin in your Circle account does not entitle you to any 
                                additional tokens or value associated with Other Digital Currencies that may 
                                result from your ownership of Supported Bitcoin, regardless of whether you 
                                would be entitled to such additional tokens or value had you held such 
                                Supported Bitcoin outside of Circle.<br><br>
                                
                                Note that in the event of a “fork” of Bitcoin, Circle may be forced to suspend all 
                                activities relating to bitcoin (including sending and receiving bitcoin) for an 
                                extended period of time until Circle has determined in its sole discretion that 
                                such functionality can be restored (“Bitcoin Downtime”). This Bitcoin 
                                Downtime will likely occur immediately upon a “fork” of Bitcoin with little to no 
                                warning, and during this period of Bitcoin Downtime you will not have access 
                                to bitcoin that you hold in your Circle account.<br><br>
                                
                                If you currently hold bitcoin in your Circle account and want to avoid any 
                                potential loss in value, loss of access to your funds on Circle, or other negative 
                                consequences that might arise from a “fork” of Bitcoin, If you currently hold 
                                bitcoin in your Circle account and want to avoid any potential loss in value, 
                                loss of access to your funds on Circle, or other negative consequences that 
                                might arise from a “fork” of Bitcoin, you should send your Bitcoin to a wallet or
                                exchange that will support multiple forks of Bitcoin.

                                With respect to any potential “fork” of bitcoin, you acknowledge and agree 
                                that (i) Circle shall determine in its sole discretion which “fork” (or “forks”) of 
                                Bitcoin it will support (“Supported Bitcoin”) and Circle shall be under no 
                                obligation to support any other “forks” or versions of Bitcoin. Unless Circle in 
                                its sole discretion chooses to do so, Circle does not and will not support any 
                                forked versions of Bitcoin, or any other digital currencies, tokens, coins or 
                                forked protocols (collectively, “Other Digital Currencies”) whether or not they 
                                are created as a result of a fork of the Bitcoin network, are independently 
                                created or otherwise, and regardless of whether or not such Other Digital 
                                Currencies hold any value. You acknowledge and agree that you will not use 
                                your Circle account to hold, send, receive or otherwise transact with any 
                                Other Digital Currencies. In the event that you attempt to use your Circle 
                                account to transact with Other Digital Currencies, Circle is under no obligation 
                                to take any measures to help you recover any such Other Digital Currencies or 
                                make you whole for any losses associated with such Other Digital Currencies. 
                                Holding Supported Bitcoin in your Circle account does not entitle you to any 
                                additional tokens or value associated with Other Digital Currencies that may 
                                result from your ownership of Supported Bitcoin, regardless of whether you 
                                would be entitled to such additional tokens or value had you held such 
                                Supported Bitcoin outside of Circle.<br><br>
                                
                                Note that in the event of a “fork” of Bitcoin, Circle may be forced to suspend all 
                                activities relating to bitcoin (including sending and receiving bitcoin) for an 
                                extended period of time until Circle has determined in its sole discretion that 
                                such functionality can be restored (“Bitcoin Downtime”). This Bitcoin 
                                Downtime will likely occur immediately upon a “fork” of Bitcoin with little to no 
                                warning, and during this period of Bitcoin Downtime you will not have access 
                                to bitcoin that you hold in your Circle account.<br><br>
                                
                                If you currently hold bitcoin in your Circle account and want to avoid any 
                                potential loss in value, loss of access to your funds on Circle, or other negative 
                                consequences that might arise from a “fork” of Bitcoin, If you currently hold

                                might arise from a “fork” of Bitcoin, you should send your Bitcoin to a wallet or

                                Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that operates on open source software 
                                protocols which can be used, modified or adapted by anyone; provided that 
                                certain changes require a certain amount of consensus among the parties 
                                using and supporting the Bitcoin network. As a result of the decentralized

                                changes (“forks”) can be made to Bitcoin. It is also possible that such forks
